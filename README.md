Welcome to **Sh--ty Aliens**, my brand-new project. It's an allegory for red and green heads or rather buttons. The **Red** is equipped with red twin and dual-eyes button like Aliens. **The Green** consists of green triple-eyes button like Aliens that haven't existed on our planet yet! It's made to be my birthday gift and I did it all by myself with flying colors including this colorful precise cake, though!
